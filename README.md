My family is a bunch of nerds and we love to share articles with each other, commenting, debating, and just sharing our thoughts. We always share articles and make comments by email, but articles get lost in everyone's inbox after a day or two. I built this so that we had a place to nerd out and share interesting things we read and get some thoughts/ideas flowing. It's still quite basic but I plan on adding more soon. 

Here's some techinal stuff:

To get started, type in the Terminal 
`npm install`

If you're having issues with node, run 

`sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm`
`brew reinstall node`


Once you have all your packages installed, run
`npm run server-dev` to get the server going in a dev environment and
`npm run react-dev` to display the front-end
